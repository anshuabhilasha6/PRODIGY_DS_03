TASK 03: BUILD A DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER TO PREDICT WHETHER THE CUSTOMER WILL PURCHASE A PRODUCT OR SERVICE BASED ON THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC AND BEHAVIORAL DATA .

For this task, I developed a Machine Learning Model to Predict whether clients will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and behavioral data.

The dataset used here is the bank-additional-full which I downloaded from the Kaggle.The dataset includes the age, martial, education, housing,etc. 

Tools ‚öíÔ∏è and libraries üìö used are :
1) Google Colab 
2) Pandas
3) Matplotlip and Seaborn 
4) warnings

Task description : The main goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can assist banking institutions in targeting clients who are more likely to subscribe to term deposits. By¬† accurately identifying potential subscribers , the institution can optimize its marketing efforts and improve campaign effectiveness.

Results:
The project resulted in the development of decision tree classifiers using both the Gini impurity and entropy criteria. The models achieved high accuracy in predicting term deposit subscriptions, with the Gini impurity criterion slightly outperforming the entropy criterion in terms of testing accuracy and recall for the positive class .

Conclusion:¬† The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning models in predicting term deposit subscriptions in direct marketing campaigns. By leveraging predictive analytics, the banking institution can optimize its marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement.
